During this bootcamp, I have acquired numerous skills that I was unfamiliar with just a few months ago. I've learned in-demand development languages within the IT field, as well as various technologies and methodologies.

I am now capable of building full-stack web applications, from backend development (server, database) to frontend development, and establishing seamless communication between both sides.

I would estimate that I am about 70% ready to embark on my new career path. I possess the necessary skills to build complete projects and have developed the ability to research solutions effectively. I am persistent and resilient, never stopping when faced with challenges or unfamiliar concepts.

However, I recognize the need to enhance my portfolio by creating a few more substantial projects to be fully prepared for the next step.

Mastering React, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and JavaScript is a significant achievement and a valuable asset to my CV and experience. I am proud of the skills I have gained throughout this bootcamp and the progress I have made on this journey.
